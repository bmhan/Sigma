#Notes on the sample code files

4 methods:
        measure_tx
        play_waveform
        setup_vsg
        main

Missing function: 
        dut_start_tx
        //
        DUT Control function w/ frequency and power_level
        //
Need to pipe output of the sample code to an error file
Figure out how to do that. Also, make sure the error measures are from the
original, unedited sample code file (not your calibration file).

overloaded "send" will return a value if there is a "?" mark, indicating that we
will expect a return value. Following the send.

Need to encapsulate the reconfiguration into a setup method, because of overuse
throughout the code.
