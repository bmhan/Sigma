# GUIs

## MiniUT_GUI_v2_shortened.py
### Added
- Menu bar, with 4 features: exit, set default values, settings,
update firmware
- exit is self-explanatory
- set default values allow user to set what the default button sets the
default values as
- settings enable special debugging features and print statements
- update firmware updates the firmware on the board; this feature is
currently commented out; uncomment to use

### Change
- Small adjustments made to the GUI appearance


## MiniUT_GUI_shortened
### Added
- Runs script test_miniUT_shortened.py
- Button resets input values to default
- Button resets input values to previous test values
- CABLE LOSS and HOST input added to account for loss in dB and getting
the connection to the Litepoint machine respectively

## MiniUT_GUI_Black_with_subprocess_old_copy
### Added
- Update of MiniUT_GUI_Black

### Changed
- Use subprocessing to run script without GUI hanging

## test_miniUT_GUI_bad_thread.py
### DOES NOT WORK

## flash_login_miniUT_GUI
### INCOMPLETE; USE "flash_miniUT_GUI" INSTEAD

## flash_miniUT_GUI
### Added
- Flash the DUT using Serial library
- User defines the path to a firmware file with a file dialog
- Update DUT firmware with the press of a button
- Implement threading to prevent GUI from crashing

## MiniUT_GUI_Black
### Added 
- Error Message Handling
- Regex logic to make sure user has not entered garbage values

### Changed 
- Runs test_miniUT_RB_PS_66311B_copy_9
- User enters only the Serial Number and the COM for the DUT

## LTE_GUI_Basic
### Added
- First version of the miniUT GUI
- Allow user to enable debugging, set gain range, enter
serial number, set voltage, and set current
- Runs test_miniUT_RB_PS_66311B with the inputed settings
- Note that this version is not multithreaded or multiprocessed,
so program hangs while the script is running
- Not recommended for use

line #735, and run the script

- Test to compare the output with expected values from input_spec.txt 

### Changed
- Creates separate .csv files for each nRB with their gain values
